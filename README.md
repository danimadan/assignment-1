My hobbies include running, hiking, skiing, swimming, rowing, I love 
anything I can do outside. Unfortunately, can't do most of these anymore 
due to my leg. However, it allows more time for some of my other hobbies 
like painting and writing. It is these outdoor adventures which first 
sparked a passion for environmental studies and sustainability, hence why 
I took this class. I am hoping to go into environmental consulting or 
something of the sort.
